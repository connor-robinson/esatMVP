Reviewing the actual section 2 scripts of the candidates will provide useful information to add \nto the decision process \u2013 in particular when considering the mathematical fluency and \naccuracy in combination with the ability to explain and understand the underlying physical \nprinciples (see question P1 comments) \nThe last three years have clearly shown that candidates do not use their time evenly, with the first \nquestion that they attempt dominating the mark profile. When considering the moderation \nspreadsheet alone, it is not apparent which was the first question; furthermore each question has a \ndifferent mean, making these marks not as useful as they could be. \n2. It would be my recommendation to Directors of Studies, therefore, that marks for each \nquestion are scaled to match the means, and the total score across both questions is then \nconsidered. (e.g. P1+C1, P1+C2). Given the means this year, this wouldn\u2019t need to be a \nlaborious process. For example, if we wished the mean for all subjects to be 10 then a simple \nscaling (calculated in the spreadsheet) using something like 10 + (\n\ud835\udc41 \u2264 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\n\u22120.5) \u221720 [which \nscales the top mark to be 20 (\n\ud835\udc41\u226420\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59= 1 ) ] would enable marks to be added and the total \nacross both questions considered. \n \nQuestion P1 \n \nThis question was designed not only to test students\u2019 mathematical ability, fluency and accuracy but \nalso to test their understanding of physical concepts and their ability to explain them. This was a \nuseful exercise as it was clear that many students (often overseas students) were able to reliably and \nefficiently perform calculations, but had no physical understanding of what this meant, and were \ntherefore unable to describe or draw the graphs in part (a) and (e). It was clear from this question that \nstudents lacked practice in explaining physical systems in a concise manner with simple short \nstatements. They often wrote complicated, confused and contradictory statements. \nFrom the last three years of marking the admissions tests, it is clear that the first question on the \npaper is attempted by the greatest number of students and, generally, students were able to make \ngood progress on this question. Our decisions about marks were therefore quite strict (to discriminate \nbetween candidates who had a clear and accurate understanding of the physics and were reliable \nand critical with their mathematics) and taken within the whole context of all of the scripts. \nMost students progressed all the way through this question \u2013 possibly to the detriment of later \nquestions. \nQuestion P2 \n \nThe question on simple circuits was designed to be accessible to most A level students who have \nstudied electric circuits. Only two equations are required; \ud835\udc49= \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc45 and \ud835\udc43=\n\ud835\udc492\n\ud835\udc45. The parts of this \nquestion were separate, requiring simple calculations or sometimes the graphs could be sketched \nwithout numerical calculations. Even within the sections the parts of the question could be \napproached without having correctly obtained the earlier answers in the section. \nSomewhat evident was the lack of practice in doing simple calculations without forgetting the \ncomponent they were meant to be considering halfway through. So a student would find some set of \npotentials across the \u201cother\u201d resistor in the circuit. This well-meaning effort on their part could be very \nfrustrating when you could see that they could have answered the question correctly.",

They could set the steps down, but they are not used to \nmultistep calculations without a support step in the middle.

The graph following could be \nobtained by sketching for the table, or quite often just from some thinking about the circuit. \nWhen \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f= 0 no power is dissipated, and when \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f is large, little current flows through it and \nagain little power is dissipated. In between power is dissipated, so the graph has a peak in it. It \nwas pleasing to see students obtaining this without necessarily having produced a table of \nresults. Students will have come across the maximum power from a cell and the fact that a \nmaximum is obtained here may not be a great surprise, although to connect the circumstance is \nperhaps hindsight here.",
