## **M1. Hidden Proportionality / Scaling**

**Core thinking move**  
Recognise how a quantity scales with size and work backwards from a ratio or difference.

**Seen in / context**

- Similar geometric objects (area vs volume)
    
- Same material, different size (mass, density, pressure)
    
- Reshaped objects (e.g. wire → resistance)
    
- Abstract “quantity scales with xnx^nxn” reasoning
    

**Possible wrong paths**

- Assuming linear scaling by default
    
- Applying the correct power but in the wrong direction
    
- Confusing ratios with absolute differences
    
- Scaling the wrong underlying quantity (e.g. radius vs diameter)
    

**Notes for generation**

- One scaling law only
    
- Numbers should collapse naturally

## Final note

This level of formalisation is **exactly right**:

- clear enough to guide AI thinking,
    
- loose enough to allow creativity,
    
- aligned with real ESAT / ENGAA design.
