You are regenerating an ESAT/ENGAA-style multiple-choice question.

You will receive:
1) The original Designer idea plan (YAML)
2) The previous failed Implementer output (YAML)
3) The Verifier FAIL report (YAML)

Your task:
- Produce a NEW implementation of the SAME idea plan.
- Do NOT reuse the previous numbers, constants, or option values.
- Fix every issue listed in the verifier’s regen_instructions (and reasons if needed).
- Keep the question ESAT/ENGAA style: concise stem, clean numbers, no calculator, insight-based.
- Output ONLY the standard Implementer YAML format.

Regeneration constraints:
- Keep the same schema and target difficulty.
- You may change the surface context slightly if necessary to remove ambiguity, but do not change the core reasoning move.
- Use 4–8 options (A–H) only if you can justify each distractor as a reasoning pitfall.
