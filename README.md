## Recent Fixes

### Authentication (Login/Logout)
- **Fixed logout functionality**: Improved logout flow to properly clear session state and handle errors. Logout now waits for signOut to complete and uses a hard redirect to ensure all session data is cleared.
- **Fixed login state detection**: Enhanced login page to check session state directly from Supabase, preventing issues where users couldn't login when already logged out due to stale session state.
- **Improved error handling**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the authentication flow for better reliability.

## Notes

- The Papers Analytics page is currently a placeholder with mock data
- All Learn and Interview routes have been removed
- Navigation has been simplified to only show Overview, Papers, and Train sections
